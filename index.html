  <h1>Pelion Energy</h1>
  <p class="sub">
    Pelion is a project incubation and delivery platform focused on transferring mature European technologies to international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name comes from the Pelion region in Greece, historically associated with knowledge, learning, and the practical application of expertise.
    This reflects our approach today: connecting experience with execution, and planning with implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pelion works with industrial partners, public authorities, and institutional stakeholders on <strong>B2B and B2G projects</strong>,
    supporting initiatives across energy, infrastructure, and applied technologies.
    We assist from early structuring through to implementation, ensuring alignment between technology providers, investors, and end users.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    All activities are carried out within established procurement frameworks and regulatory environments.

</section>

<section class="divider">
  <h2>Technology &amp; markets</h2>
  <p>
    Pelion works with technologies that are already applied, regulated, and operational in Europe.
    These solutions are transferred and adapted to international markets where institutional or industrial demand exists,
    local partnerships are in place, and regulatory and procurement frameworks allow for structured implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our activities span <strong>B2B and B2G projects</strong>. India represents a key focus area, alongside engagement with other regions
    where comparable partnerships and project conditions apply.
